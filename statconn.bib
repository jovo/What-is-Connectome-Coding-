              deployment in large cohorts has enabled an assessment of
              functional and structural brain network architecture at an
              unprecedented level of detail. Across many temporal and spatial
              scales, network neuroscience has emerged as a central focus of
              intellectual efforts, seeking meaningful descriptions of brain
              networks and explanatory sets of network features that underlie
              circuit function in health and dysfunction in disease. However,
              the tools of network science commonly deployed provide insight
              into brain function at a fundamentally descriptive level, often
              failing to identify (patho-)physiological mechanisms that link
              system-level phenomena to the multiple hierarchies of brain
              function. Here we describe recently developed techniques stemming
              from advances in complex systems and network science that have
              the potential to overcome this limitation, thereby contributing
              mechanistic insights into neuroanatomy, functional dynamics, and
              pathology. Finally, we build on the Research Domain Criteria
              framework, highlighting the notion that mental illnesses can be
              conceptualized as dysfunctions of neural circuitry present across
              conventional diagnostic boundaries, to sketch how network-based
              methods can be combined with pharmacological, intermediate

                   registered into a coherent volume prior to further analysis.
                   A common registration strategy is to find matching features
                   between neighboring and overlapping image pairs, followed by
                   a numerical estimation of optimal image deformation using a
                   so-called solver program. Existing solvers are inadequate
                   for large data volumes, and inefficient for small-scale
                   image registration. In this work, an efficient and accurate
                   matrix-based solver method is presented. A linear system is
                   constructed that combines minimization of feature-pair
                   square distances with explicit constraints in a
                   regularization term. In absence of reliable priors for
                   regularization, we show how to construct a rigid-model

                   using available computer programs, whose performance on
                   typical registration tasks we briefly compare, and to which
                   future scale-up is delegated. Our method is applied to the

              the anatomical basis of this recurrent synaptic network is

                   initially shaped by genetics and subsequently refined by the

                   factors or human traits, such as substance use and
                   cognition. Due to limitations in structural connectome
                   recovery, previous studies largely focus on functional
                   connectomes. Questions remain about how well structural
                   connectomes can explain variance in different human traits.
                   Using a state-of-the-art structural connectome processing
                   pipeline and a novel dimensionality reduction technique
                   applied to data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we

                   various human traits. Our dimensionality reduction approach
                   uses a tensor characterization of the connectome and relies
                   on a generalization of principal components analysis. We

                   fluid intelligence, language comprehension, and motor skills
                   are associated with increased cortical-cortical brain
                   structural connectivity, while the use of alcohol, tobacco,

              to contribute to the cognitive changes underlying mental illness.
              These observations have seemed to support various theories
              postulating large-scale disruptions of brain systems in mental
              illness. However, existing approaches isolate differences in
              network organization without putting those differences in broad,
              whole-brain perspective. Using a graph distance measure -
              connectome-wide correlation - we found that whole-brain
              resting-state functional network organization in humans is highly
              similar across a variety of mental diseases and healthy controls.
              This similarity was observed across autism spectrum disorder,
              attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.
              Nonetheless, subtle differences in network graph distance were

              connectomes differ little across health and disease those
              differences are informative. Such small network alterations may
              reflect the fact that most psychiatric patients maintain overall
              cognitive abilities similar to those of healthy individuals
              (relative to, e.g., the most severe schizophrenia cases), such
              that whole-brain functional network organization is expected to
              differ only subtly even for mental diseases with devastating

              transdiagnostic phenomena through a single general factor,
              sometimes referred to as the ``p'' factor, associated with risk
              for all common forms of mental illness. METHODS: We build on
              previous research identifying unique structural neural correlates
              of the p factor by conducting a data-driven analysis of
              connectome-wide intrinsic functional connectivity (n = 605).
              RESULTS: We demonstrate that higher p factor scores and

              frontoparietal and default mode networks. CONCLUSIONS: These

              Project, revealing a reliable degree of between-subject
              correlation in the local connectome fingerprints, with a
              relatively complex, low-dimensional substructure. Using a
              cross-validated, high-dimensional regression analysis approach,
              we derived local connectome phenotype (LCP) maps that could
              reliably predict a subset of subject attributes measured,
              including demographic, health, and cognitive measures. These LCP
              maps were highly specific to the attribute being predicted but
              also sensitive to correlations between attributes. Collectively,
              these results indicate that the local architecture of white

               naturally in neuroscience, social networks, and machine
               learning. In this article, we consider a semiparametric problem
               of two-sample hypothesis testing for a class of latent position
               random graphs. We formulate a notion of consistency in this
               context and propose a valid test for the hypothesis that two
               finite-dimensional random dot product graphs on a common vertex
               set have the same generating latent positions or have generating
               latent positions that are scaled or diagonal transformations of
               one another. Our test statistic is a function of a spectral
               decomposition of the adjacency matrix for each graph and our
               test procedure is consistent across a broad range of
               alternatives. We apply our test procedure to real biological
               data: in a test-retest dataset of neural connectome graphs, we
               are able to distinguish between scans from different subjects;
               and in the C. elegans connectome, we are able to distinguish
               between chemical and electrical networks. The latter example is
               a concrete demonstration that our test can have power even for
               small-sample sizes. We conclude by discussing the relationship

              biological variation currently unaccounted for by contemporary
              diagnostic categories, thereby enhancing the ability of
              neurobiological studies to characterize brain-behavior
              relationships. METHODS: A community-ascertained sample of
              individuals (N = 347, 18-59 years of age) completed a battery of
              behavioral measures, psychiatric assessment, and resting-state
              functional magnetic resonance imaging in a cross-sectional
              design. Bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis was applied
              to 49 phenotypic subscales from 10 measures. Hybrid hierarchical
              clustering was applied to resultant factor scores to identify
              nested groups. Adjacent groups were compared via independent
              samples t tests and chi-square tests of factor scores, syndrome
              scores, and psychiatric prevalence. Multivariate distance matrix
              regression examined functional connectome differences between
              adjacent groups. RESULTS: Reduction yielded six factors, which
              explained 77.8\% and 65.4\% of the variance in exploratory and
              constrained exploratory models, respectively. Hybrid hierarchical
              clustering of these six factors identified two, four, and eight
              nested groups (i.e., phenotypic communities). At the highest
              clustering level, the algorithm differentiated functionally
              adaptive and maladaptive groups. At the middle clustering level,
              groups were separated by problem type (maladaptive groups;
              internalizing vs. externalizing problems) and behavioral type
              (adaptive groups; sensation-seeking vs. extraverted/emotionally
              stable). Unique phenotypic profiles were also evident at the
              lowest clustering level. Group comparisons exhibited significant
              differences in intrinsic functional connectivity at the highest
              clustering level in somatomotor, thalamic, basal ganglia, and
              limbic networks. CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven approaches for
              identifying homogenous subgroups, spanning typical function to
              dysfunction, not only yielded clinically meaningful groups, but
              also captured behavioral and neurobiological variation among

               to a clear role in cognition demands advances in the theoretical
               frameworks, algorithms, and experimental approaches applied.
               This would help evolve the field from a descriptive to an
               explanatory state, by targeting network interactions that can
               mechanistically account for cognitive effects. In the present

               ``network mechanisms'', which anchors recent methodological
               advances in functional connectivity estimation to a renewed
               emphasis on careful experimental design. We emphasize how this
               framework can address specific questions in network

               framework to highlight the mechanistic interaction of network
               components that remain ``stable'' across task domains and more
               ``flexible'' components associated with on-task reconfiguration.
               By emphasizing the need to structure the use of diverse analytic
               approaches with sound experimentation, our framework promotes an

              conservation. Most of the genes for which we detected peptides
              were highly conserved. We found peptides for >96\% of genes that
              evolved before bilateria. At the opposite end of the scale, we
              identified almost no peptides for genes that have appeared since

abstract = {In statistical connectomics, the quantitative study of brain networks, estimating the mean of a population of graphs based on a sample is a core problem. Often, this problem is especially difficult because the sample or cohort size is relatively small, sometimes even a single subject. While using the element-wise sample mean of the adjacency matrices is a common approach, this method does not exploit any underlying structural properties of the graphs. We propose using a low-rank method which incorporates tools for dimension selection and diagonal augmentation to smooth the estimates and improve performance over the naive methodology for small sample sizes. Theoretical results for the stochastic blockmodel show that this method offers major improvements when there are many vertices. Similarly, we demonstrate that the low-rank methods outperform the standard sample mean for a variety of independent edge distributions as well as human connectome data derived from magnetic resonance imaging, especially when sample sizes are small. Moreover, the low-rank methods yield "eigen-connectomes", which correlate with the lobe-structure of the human brain and superstructures of the mouse brain. These results indicate that low-rank methods are an important part of the tool box for researchers studying populations of graphs in general, and statistical connectomics in particular.},

              widely held view that neural wiring length should be minimized.
              These results show that mammalian muscle function is implemented

              those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the
              sensory drive to its motor program, which relieves suppression of
              the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress
              down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked
              cleaning movements activated in parallel, but selected serially
              through hierarchical suppression, was successful in reproducing
              the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an

  abstract  = "Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data
               sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors.
               Social networks, representing people who communicate with each
               other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly
               connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of
               several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and
               computationally feasible method to discover these communities.
               The Stochastic Block Model (Holland et al., 1983) is a social
               network model with well defined communities; each node is a
               member of one community. For a network generated from the
               Stochastic Block Model, we bound the number of nodes
               ``misclustered'' by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results
               in this paper are the first clustering results that allow the
               number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of
               nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to study
               spectral clustering under the Stochastic Block Model, we first
               show that under the more general latent space model, the
               eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically
               converge to the eigenvectors of a ``population'' normalized
               graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for spectral
               clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the

               data from 1003 healthy adults, we investigate a broad array of
               network centrality measures to provide novel insights into
               connectivity within the whole-brain functional network (i.e.,
               the functional connectome). We first assemble and visualize the
               voxel-wise (4 mm) functional connectome as a functional network.
               We then demonstrate that each centrality measure captures
               different aspects of connectivity, highlighting the importance
               of considering both global and local connectivity properties of
               the functional connectome. Beyond ``detecting functional hubs,''
               we treat centrality as measures of functional connectivity

                 functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for
                 Reliability and Reproducibility, to estimate connectomes.
                 Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran
                 on 25 different studies (~6,000 scans) from 15 sites, with
                 each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as
                 assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each
                 processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG
                 are more similar within than across individuals, indicating
                 that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the
                 connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain
                 connectional properties across every scan, individual, study,
                 site, and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than
                 contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than
                 heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences
                 varied across individuals and studies - much more so when
                 pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study,
                 site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and
                 ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables
                 (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to
                 this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the
                 value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding
                 the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We,
                 therefore, provide a set of principles to guide the
                 development of pipelines capable of pooling data across
                 studies while maintaining biological variability and
                 minimizing measurement error. This open science approach
                 provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually
                 mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.",

                   important applications in statistical inference on graphs.
                   We propose a method to jointly embed multiple undirected

                   identifies a linear subspace spanned by rank one symmetric

               risk and resilience across the lifespan. To attain these
               objectives, sufficiently powered datasets with broad and deep
               phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and
               genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to
               the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline
               Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need.
               NKI-RS is an ongoing, institutionally centered endeavor aimed at
               creating a large-scale (N > 1000), deeply phenotyped,
               community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old)
               with advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be
               publically shared, openly, and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly
               basis). Herein, we describe the conceptual basis of the NKI-RS,
               including study design, sampling considerations, and steps to
               synchronize phenotypic and neuroimaging assessment.
               Additionally, we describe our process for sharing the data with
               the scientific community while protecting participant
               confidentiality, maintaining an adequate database, and

               sharing data, is discussed while also explaining how this

               is our hope that familiarity with the conceptual underpinnings
               of the enhanced NKI-RS will facilitate harmonization with future

  abstract = "Various resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures have been developed
              to characterize intrinsic brain activity. While each of these
              measures has gained a growing presence in the literature,
              questions remain regarding the common and unique aspects these
              indices capture. The present work provided a comprehensive
              examination of inter-individual variation and intra-individual
              temporal variation for commonly used measures, including
              fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional
              homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, network
              centrality and global signal correlation. Regardless of whether
              examining intra-individual or inter-individual variation, we
              found that these definitionally distinct R-fMRI indices tend to
              exhibit a relatively high degree of covariation, which doesn't
              exist in phase randomized surrogate data. As a measure of
              intrinsic brain function, concordance for R-fMRI indices was
              negatively correlated with age across individuals (i.e.,
              concordance among functional indices decreased with age). To
              understand the functional significance of concordance, we noted
              that higher concordance was generally associated with higher
              strengths of R-fMRI indices, regardless of whether looking
              through the lens of inter-individual (i.e., high vs. low
              concordance participants) or intra-individual (i.e., high vs. low
              concordance states identified via temporal dynamic analyses)
              differences. We also noted a linear increase in functional
              concordance together with the R-fMRI indices through the scan,
              which may suggest a decrease in arousal. The current study
              demonstrated an enriched picture regarding the relationship among
              the R-fMRI indices, as well as provided new insights in examining

              encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that
              impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing.
              In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in
              the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two
              grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project
              (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging

               method that is being increasingly applied to fMRI data. A
               principal advantage of this approach is its applicability to
               cognitive paradigms for which detailed models of brain activity
               are not available. Independent component analysis has been
               successfully utilized to analyze single-subject fMRI data sets,
               and an extension of this work would be to provide for group
               inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression
               analysis, Kolmogorov--Smirnov statistics), ICA does not
               naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences
               about groups of subjects. We introduce a novel approach for
               drawing group inferences using ICA of fMRI data, and present its
               application to a simple visual paradigm that alternately
               stimulates the left or right visual field. Our group ICA
               analysis revealed task-related components in left and right

               occipital/parietal cortex, and a non-task-related component in
               bilateral visual association cortex. We address issues involved
               in the use of ICA as an fMRI analysis method such as: (1) How
               many components should be calculated? (2) How are these

                 variations in the functional connectome across studies and
                 individuals, concerns about the many sources of nuisance
                 variation present and their impact on resting state fMRI
                 (R-fMRI) measures continue to grow. Although substantial
                 within-site variation can exist, efforts to aggregate data
                 across multiple sites such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes
                 Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing
                 Initiative (INDI) datasets amplify these concerns. The present
                 work draws upon standardization approaches commonly used in
                 the microarray gene expression literature, and to a lesser
                 extent recent imaging studies, and compares them with respect
                 to their impact on relationships between common R-fMRI
                 measures and nuisance variables (e.g., imaging site, motion),
                 as well as phenotypic variables of interest (age, sex).
                 Standardization approaches differed with regard to whether
                 they were applied post-hoc vs. during pre-processing, and at
                 the individual vs. group level; additionally they varied in
                 whether they addressed additive effects vs.
                 additive+multiplicative effects, and were parametric vs.
                 non-parametric. While all standardization approaches were
                 effective at reducing undesirable relationships with nuisance
                 variables, post-hoc approaches were generally more effective
                 than global signal regression (GSR). Across approaches,
                 correction for additive effects (global mean) appeared to be
                 more important than for multiplicative effects (global SD) for
                 all R-fMRI measures, with the exception of amplitude of low
                 frequency fluctuations (ALFF). Group-level post-hoc
                 standardizations for mean-centering and
                 variance-standardization were found to be advantageous in
                 their ability to avoid the introduction of artifactual
                 relationships with standardization parameters; though results
                 between individual and group-level post-hoc approaches were
                 highly similar overall. While post-hoc standardization
                 procedures drastically increased test-retest (TRT) reliability
                 for ALFF, modest reductions were observed for other measures
                 after post-hoc standardizations-a phenomena likely
                 attributable to the separation of voxel-wise from global
                 differences among subjects (global mean and SD demonstrated
                 moderate TRT reliability for these measures). Finally, the
                 present work calls into question previous observations of
                 increased anatomical specificity for GSR over mean centering,
                 and draws attention to the near equivalence of global and gray
                 matter signal regression.",

                   example, when the same underlying process is observed using
                   several different modalities, or measured with different

              neurons embody some of the most stereotyped circuits in one of
              the most miniaturized of animal brains. The reconstructions allow
              us, for the first time to our knowledge, to study variations
              between circuits in the medulla's neighboring columns. This
              variation in the number of synapses and the types of their
              synaptic partners has previously been little addressed because
              methods that visualize multiple circuits have not resolved
              detailed connections, and existing connectomic studies, which can
              see such connections, have not so far examined multiple
              reconstructions of the same circuit. Here, we address the
              omission by comparing the circuits common to all seven columns to
              assess variation in their connection strengths and the resultant
              rates of several different and distinct types of connection
              error. Error rates reveal that, overall, <1\% of contacts are not
              part of a consensus circuit, and we classify those contacts that
              supplement (E+) or are missing from it (E-). Autapses, in which
              the same cell is both presynaptic and postsynaptic at the same
              synapse, are occasionally seen; two cells in particular, Dm9 and
              Mi1, form $\geq$ 20-fold more autapses than do other neurons.
              These results delimit the accuracy of developmental events that
              establish and normally maintain synaptic circuits with such
              precision, and thereby address the operation of such circuits.

              motion, has long been analysed using Hassenstein-Reichardt (HR)
              detector or Barlow-Levick (BL) models. These both simulate motion

A consortium of HCP investigators will study a population of 1200 healthy adults using multiple imaging modalities, along with extensive behavioral and genetic data. In this overview, we focus on diffusion MRI (dMRI) and the structural connectivity aspect of the project. We present recent advances in acquisition and processing that allow us to obtain very high-quality in-vivo MRI data, while enabling scanning of a very large number of subjects. These advances result from 2 years of intensive efforts in optimising many aspects of data acquisition and processing during the piloting phase of the project. The data quality and methods described here are representative of the datasets and processing pipelines that will be made freely available to the community at quarterly intervals, beginning in 2013.},

Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used in both scientific research and clinical practice in in-vivo studies of the human brain. While a number of post-processing packages have been developed, fully automated processing of dMRI datasets remains challenging. Here, we developed a MATLAB toolbox named "Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges" (PANDA) for fully automated processing of brain diffusion images. The processing modules of a few established packages, including FMRIB Software Library (FSL), Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM), Diffusion Toolkit and MRIcron, were employed in PANDA. Using any number of raw dMRI datasets from different subjects, in either DICOM or NIfTI format, PANDA can automatically perform a series of steps to process DICOM/NIfTI to diffusion metrics [e.g., fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)] that are ready for statistical analysis at the voxel-level, the atlas-level and the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS)-level and can finish the construction of anatomical brain networks for all subjects. In particular, PANDA can process different subjects in parallel, using multiple cores either in a single computer or in a distributed computing environment, thus greatly reducing the time cost when dealing with a large number of datasets. In addition, PANDA has a friendly graphical user interface (GUI), allowing the user to be interactive and to adjust the input/output settings, as well as the processing parameters. As an open-source package, PANDA is freely available at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/panda/. This novel toolbox is expected to substantially simplify the image processing of dMRI datasets and facilitate human structural connectome studies.},

month={Feb},

abstract={Low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI signal have been used to map several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. Global variations of the BOLD signal are often considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general linear model (GLM) technique. This global signal regression method has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard fMRI analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values. A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero. Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause of anti-correlations. These results call into question the interpretation of negatively correlated regions in the brain when using global signal regression as an initial processing step.},

abstract={Synchronized low-frequency BOLD fluctuations are observed in dissociable large-scale, distributed networks with functional specialization. Two such networks, referred to as the task-positive network (TPN) and the task-negative network (TNN) because they tend to be active or inactive during cognitively demanding tasks, show reproducible anticorrelation of resting BOLD fluctuations after removal of the global brain signal. Because global signal regression mandates that anticorrelated regions to a given seed region must exist, it is unclear whether such anticorrelations are an artifact of global regression or an intrinsic property of neural activity. In this study, we demonstrate from simulated data that spurious anticorrelations are introduced during global regression for any two networks as a linear function of their size. Using actual resting state data, we also show that both the TPN and TNN become anticorrelated with the orbits when soft tissues are included in the global regression algorithm. Finally, we propose a technique using phase-shifted soft tissue regression (PSTCor) that allows improved correction of global physiological artifacts without global regression that shows improved anatomic specificity to global regression but does not show significant network anticorrelations. These results imply that observed anticorrelations between TNN and TPN may be largely or entirely artifactual in the resting state. These results also imply that differences in network anticorrelations attributed to pathophysiological or behavioral states may be due to differences in network size or recruitment rather than actual anticorrelations.},

    abstract = {{
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) holds the promise of revealing brain functional connectivity without requiring specific tasks targeting particular brain systems. RS-FMRI is being used to find differences between populations even when a specific candidate target for traditional inferences is lacking. However, the problem with RS-FMRI is a lacking definition of what constitutes noise and signal. RS-FMRI is easy to acquire but is not easy to analyze or draw inferences from. In this commentary we discuss a problem that is still treated lightly despite its significant impact on RS-FMRI inferences; global signal regression (GSReg), the practice of projecting out signal averaged over the entire brain, can change resting-state correlations in ways that dramatically alter correlation patterns and hence conclusions about brain functional connectedness. Although Murphy et al. in 2009 demonstrated that GSReg negatively biases correlations, the approach remains in wide use. We revisit this issue to argue the problem that GSReg is more than negative bias or the interpretability of negative correlations. Its usage can fundamentally alter interregional correlations within a group, or their differences between groups. We used an illustrative model to clearly convey our objections and derived equations formalizing our conclusions. We hope this creates a clear context in which counterarguments can be made. We conclude that GSReg should not be used when studying RS-FMRI because GSReg biases correlations differently in different regions depending on the underlying true interregional correlation structure. GSReg can alter local and long-range correlations, potentially spreading underlying group differences to regions that may never have had any. Conclusions also apply to substitutions of GSReg for denoising with decompositions of signals aggregated over the network's regions to the extent they cannot separate signals of interest from noise. We touch on the need for careful accounting of nuisance parameters when making group comparisons of correlation maps.

                 other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical
                 between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images
                 across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional

abstract = {In 2007 we introduced a general model of sparse random graphs with (conditional) independence between the edges. The aim of this paper is to present an extension of this model in which the edges are far from inde-pendent, and to prove several results about this extension. The basic idea is to construct the random graph by adding not only edges but also other small graphs. In other words, we first construct an inhomogeneous ran-dom hypergraph with (conditionally) independent hyperedges, and then replace each hyperedge by a (perhaps complete) graph. Although flexi-ble enough to produce graphs with significant dependence between edges, this model is nonetheless mathematically tractable. Indeed, we find the critical point where a giant component emerges in full generality, in terms of the norm of a certain integral operator, and relate the size of the giant component to the survival probability of a certain (non-Poisson) multi-type branching process. While our main focus is the phase transition, we also study the degree distribution and the numbers of small subgraphs. We illustrate the model with a simple special case that produces graphs with power-law degree sequences with a wide range of degree exponents and clustering coefficients.},

  title    = "{ADHD} diagnosis from multiple data sources with batch effects",
  author   = "Olivetti, Emanuele and Greiner, Susanne and Avesani, Paolo",
  abstract = "The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects the
              school-age population and has large social costs. The scientific
              community is still lacking a pathophysiological model of the
              disorder and there are no objective biomarkers to support the
              diagnosis. In 2011 the ADHD-200 Consortium provided a rich,
              heterogeneous neuroimaging dataset aimed at studying neural
              correlates of ADHD and to promote the development of systems for
              automated diagnosis. Concurrently a competition was set up with
              the goal of addressing the wide range of different types of data
              for the accurate prediction of the presence of ADHD. Phenotypic
              information, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
              and resting state fMRI recordings were provided for nearly 1000
              typical and non-typical young individuals. Data were collected by
              eight different research centers in the consortium. This work is
              not concerned with the main task of the contest, i.e., achieving
              a high prediction accuracy on the competition dataset, but we
              rather address the proper handling of such a heterogeneous
              dataset when performing classification-based analysis. Our
              interest lies in the clustered structure of the data causing the
              so-called batch effects which have strong impact when assessing
              the performance of classifiers built on the ADHD-200 dataset. We
              propose a method to eliminate the biases introduced by such batch
              effects. Its application on the ADHD-200 dataset generates such a
              significant drop in prediction accuracy that most of the
              conclusions from a standard analysis had to be revised. In
              addition we propose to adopt the dissimilarity representation to
              set up effective representation spaces for the heterogeneous
              ADHD-200 dataset. Moreover we propose to evaluate the quality of
              predictions through a recently proposed test of independence in
              order to cope with the unbalancedness of the dataset.",

                 arbitrary units, making scans non-comparable across sites and
                 between subjects. Intensity normalization is a first step for
                 the improvement of comparability of the images across
                 subjects. However, we show that unwanted inter-scan
                 variability associated with imaging site, scanner effect, and
                 other technical artifacts is still present after standard
                 intensity normalization in large multi-site neuroimaging
                 studies. We propose RAVEL (Removal of Artificial Voxel Effect
                 by Linear regression), a tool to remove residual technical
                 variability after intensity normalization. As proposed by SVA
                 and RUV [Leek and Storey, 2007, 2008, Gagnon-Bartsch and
                 Speed, 2012], two batch effect correction tools largely used
                 in genomics, we decompose the voxel intensities of images
                 registered to a template into a biological component and an
                 unwanted variation component. The unwanted variation component
                 is estimated from a control region obtained from the
                 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where intensities are known to be
                 unassociated with disease status and other clinical
                 covariates. We perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) of
                 the control voxels to estimate factors of unwanted variation.
                 We then estimate the unwanted factors using linear regression
                 for every voxel of the brain and take the residuals as the
                 RAVEL-corrected intensities. We assess the performance of
                 RAVEL using T1-weighted (T1-w) images from more than 900
                 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
                 impairment (MCI), as well as healthy controls from the
                 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
                 We compare RAVEL to two intensity-normalization-only methods:
                 histogram matching and White Stripe. We show that RAVEL
                 performs best at improving the replicability of the brain
                 regions that are empirically found to be most associated with
                 AD, and that these regions are significantly more present in
                 structures impacted by AD (hippocampus, amygdala,
                 parahippocampal gyrus, enthorinal area, and fornix stria
                 terminals). In addition, we show that the RAVEL-corrected
                 intensities have the best performance in distinguishing
                 between MCI subjects and healthy subjects using the mean
                 hippocampal intensity (AUC=67\%), a marked improvement
                 compared to results from intensity normalization alone
                 (AUC=63\% and 59\% for histogram matching and White Stripe,

                 obstacle to their application as an instrument for clinical
                 diagnostics. In this paper, several aspects of poor
                 reproducibility are analyzed. All of them belong to the
                 category of interpretive weaknesses of DNA microarray
                 technology. First, the attention is drawn to the fact that
                 absence of the information regarding post-transcriptional mRNA
                 stability makes it impossible to evaluate the level of gene
                 activity from the relative mRNA abundances, the quantities
                 available from microarray measurements. Second, irreducible
                 intracellular variability with persistent patterns of
                 stochasticity and burstiness put natural limits to
                 reproducibility. Third, strong interactions within
                 intracellular biomolecular networks make it highly problematic
                 to build a bridge between transcription rates of individual
                 genes and structural fidelity of their genetic codes. For
                 these reasons, the microarray measurements of relative mRNA
                 abundances are more appropriate in laboratory settings as a
                 tool for scientific research, hypotheses generating and
                 producing the leads for subsequent validation through more
                 sophisticated technologies. As to clinical settings, where
                 firm conclusive diagnoses, not the leads for further
                 experimentation, are required, microarrays still have a long

              test--retest reliability, but open questions remain. These
              include how amount of data per subject influences whole-brain
              reliability, the influence of increasing runs versus sessions,
              the spatial distribution of reliability, the reliability of
              multivariate methods, and, crucially, how reliability maps onto
              prediction of behavior. We collected a dataset of 12 extensively
              sampled individuals (144 min data each across 2 identically
              configured scanners) to assess test--retest reliability of
              whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability theory
              framework. We used Human Connectome Project data to replicate
              these analyses and relate reliability to behavioral prediction.
              Overall, the historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability
              averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions
              was more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest
              for subcortical connections and highest for within-network
              cortical connections. Multivariate reliability was greater than
              univariate. Finally, reliability could not be used to improve

There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.},

abstract = {Typically in neuroimaging we are looking to extract some pertinent information from imperfect, noisy images of the brain. This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.},

abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

abstract = {The human visual system contains an array of topographically organized regions. Identifying these regions in individual subjects is a powerful approach to group-level statistical analysis, but this is not always feasible. We addressed this limitation by generating probabilistic maps of visual topographic areas in 2 standardized spaces suitable for use with adult human brains. Using standard fMRI paradigms, we identified 25 topographic maps in a large population of individual subjects (N = 53) and transformed them into either a surface-or volume-based standardized space. Here, we provide a quantitative characterization of the inter-subject variability within and across visual regions, including the likelihood that a given point would be classified as a part of any region (full probability map) and the most probable region for any given point (maximum probability map). By evaluating the topographic organization across the whole of visual cortex, we provide new information about the organization of individual visual field maps and large-scale biases in visual field coverage. Finally, we validate each atlas for use with independent subjects. Overall, the probabilistic atlases quantify the variability of topographic representations in human cortex and provide a useful reference for comparing data across studies that can be transformed into these standard spaces.},

@article{klein,
abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

abstract = {For more than a century, neuroscientists have sought to subdivide the human cerebral cortex into a patchwork of anatomically and functionally distinct areas. Until now such maps have relied largely on only a single property such as micro-architecture or functional imaging, have been based on a relatively small number of individuals, and have usually been blurry due to misalignment of brain areas from person to person. Matthew Glasser, David Van Essen and colleagues have tackled these deficiencies in a new more 'universal' map of the human cerebral cortex by integrating multi-modal imaging data obtained from 210 healthy subjects and validated on 210 other individuals. The authors propose a total of 180 areas per cerebral hemisphere (97 of them previously unknown) and apply a machine-learning classifier to automatically identify these areas in new subjects, even in individuals with atypical parcellations. This freely available resource will enhance the anatomical accuracy and interpretability of future structural and functional studies of the human brain in health and disease.},

abstract = {Typically in neuroimaging we are looking to extract some pertinent information from imperfect, noisy images of the brain. This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has been widely applied to explore group and individual differences. A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements ({\textgreater}0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks--two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions--a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals.},

abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

abstract = {Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), Oxford, UK Objective Finding brain, skull and scalp surfaces has impor-tant applications, especially in EEG/MEG mod-elling, where this allows one to use more accurate models than those often used at present. BET2 (Brain Extraction Tool v2) is a fast and fully au-tomated tool for extracting brain, inner and outer skull and scalp surfaces from MR images. It ideally requires a pair of T1-and T2-weighted images, preferably of 2mm resolution. BET2 can output mesh surfaces (useful for BEM-based algorithms) and filled images (useful for FEM-based methods). BET2 is based on BET [Smith 2002], which finds the brain boundary given an MR image. BET can attempt to find external skull surface voxels, but does not fit a surface to this, and the result-ing crude " skull " image contains a relatively large number of false negatives and positives. Method BET2 uses high-resolution T1-and T2-weighted images, though can run (with less accuracy) given only a T1. First, the brain surface is found us-ing the original BET algorithm using the T1. The T2 is then registered to the T1, normally using FLIRT [Jenkinson 2002]. Generally, in an MR image, the skull appears darker than brain and other tissues. Its inten-sity is comparable to that of background. In T1-weighted images, CSF is dark, sometimes as low as air/skull. In T2, CSF is bright, and muscles are often dark (making muscle hard to distinguish from skull). The relative intensity of brain and scalp on T1 can vary a lot from one scanner to another. In or-der to increase the robustness to these variations, we constrain the maximum scalp intensity rela-tive to the brain intensities. To avoid the problem of over-bright scalp, we compute a maximum in-tensity threshold; we take the " robust range " of intensities within the extracted brain volume (this being the 2{\%} and 98{\%} points in the cumulative histogram of brain voxel intensities) and increase the upper value by 10{\%} of this range. We then clamp all voxels (in the whole-head image) to this. For each vertex on the brain surface, the perpen-dicular direction is searched outwards for estima-tion of 3 points -the inner and outer skull, and the outer scalp. Various rules are used, which are now presented in simplified form. First, the outer scalp point is found, by combin-ing the outermost non-dark T1 point and the out-ermost non-dark T2 point (thresholds determined from robust histogramming). Next, the inner skull point is found as a combina-tion of searches (outwards from the brain) for the " first dark " T1 and T2 points. The outer skull point is harder to find robustly, due to topological complications in certain re-gions and the presence of bone marrow within the skull; a more complex combination of the T2 and T1 profiles is used to identify the most likely point, followed by correction on the basis of prox-imity to the inner skull point. This approach de-tects correctly the outer skull points in much of the head, but fails in the lower areas, where tis-sues and skull topology are too complex. Thus we have an alternative algorithm for those areas. To determine the area in which this alternative al-gorithm is needed, we use a priori spatial knowl-edge: this area has been manually determined in standard space and consists of a lower, frontal re-gion. We use FLIRT to derive a standard space transform matrix and transform this mask into the space of our data. The outer skin and inner skull points are detected as explained above. The outer skull is detected as the first point over a 35{\%} threshold after the first point under a 25{\%} thresh-old on the T1 profile. If this first point is too far (greater than 7mm) outside the inner skull we re-vert to the simplified assumption that the outer skull point is 0.5mm outside the inner skull point. Finally, an image is created for each of the 3 sur-faces, using the points found; these are slightly blurred (HWHM=3mm) primarily to increase the " attraction area " for mesh fitting. Deformable meshes are then fit to these images for all sur-faces, with cross-and self-intersection prevented.},

The displacement fields are modelled as linear combinations of basis-functions, which may be the discrete Cosine transform (DCT) or cubic B-splines placed on a regular grid. Regularisation of the field is based on membrane energy. At present the registration is based on a weighted sum of scaled sum-of-squared differences and me-brane energy. Great effort has been placed on the optimisation, and on providing computational tools to enable robust and rapid convergence even for relatively high resolution of the warps. The results that are presented are based on a multi-scale Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. The registration is initialised and run to convergence with sub-sampled images, a field of low resolution and a high regularisation weight. The images and the fields from the first step are then up-sampled, the regularisation modified and it is again run to convergence. This is repeated until the required warp-resolution and level of regularisation is achieved. The method has been tested with promising results on T1-weighted structural images and on FA-images from DTI acqusitions.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T In resting state fMRI, it is necessary to remove signal variance associated with noise sources, leaving cleaned fMRI time-series that more accurately reflect the underlying intrinsic brain fluctuations of interest. This is commonly achieved through nuisance regression, in which the fit is calculated of a noise model of head motion and physiological processes to the fMRI data in a General Linear Model, and the " cleaned " residuals of this fit are used in further analysis. We examine the statistical assumptions and requirements of the General Linear Model, and whether these are met during nuisance regression of resting state fMRI data. Using toy examples and real data we show how pre-whitening, temporal filtering and temporal shifting of regressors impact model fit. Based on our own observations, existing literature, and statistical theory, we make the following recommendations when employing nuisance regression: pre-whitening should be applied to achieve valid statistical inference of the noise model fit parameters; temporal filtering should be incorporated into the noise model to best account for changes in degrees of freedom; temporal shifting of regressors, although merited, should be achieved via optimisation and validation of a single temporal shift. We encourage all readers to make simple, practical changes to their fMRI denoising pipeline, and to regularly assess the appropriateness of the noise model used. By negotiating the potential pitfalls described in this paper, and by clearly reporting the details of nuisance regression in future manuscripts, we hope that the field will achieve more accurate and precise noise models for cleaning the resting state fMRI time-series.},

However, many of the most commonly used techniques have not been systematically evaluated using a broad range of outcome measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 14 participant-level confound regression methods in 393 youths. Specifically, we compare methods according to four benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity, distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, network identifiability, and additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but result in distance-dependent artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Importantly, less effective de-noising methods are also unable to identify modular network structure in the connectome. Taken together, these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of existing methods, and suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context of specific scientific goals.

abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},
